# How to configure the Airtable plugin

To use the Airtable plugin, you must copy/paste your Personal Access Token, which you can find <a href="https://airtable.com/create/tokens" target="_blank" class="ww-editor-link">on your account</a>.

Make sure to give it access to the base you want to use in your project.

Also, give it the proper scopes so that WeWeb can read and write data:
- `data.records:read`
- `data.records:write`
- `schema.bases:read`
