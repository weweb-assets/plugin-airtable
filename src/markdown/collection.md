2. Then, select [the table](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021333094-Getting-started-tables-records-and-fields#table) in this base you want to use.
3. Now is the time to select a view. [Views in Airtable](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042311914-What-is-a-view-) are filtered and sorted representation of the data in a table.
4. Optionally, you can filter and sort data in your collection. Filtering is based on [Airtable's formulas](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-field-reference).
